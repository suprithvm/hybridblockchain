# Gas Fee System Roadmap

## 1. Integration with Transaction Layer (Priority: High)
- [x] Gas estimation system
- [x] Fee preview functionality
- [x] Test coverage for fee preview
- [ ] Connect gas system with transaction creation
    - Update Transaction struct to use new gas fields
    - Add gas validation during transaction creation
    - Implement fee checks in mempool acceptance

## 2. User Interface & API (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create CLI commands for:
    - Get current gas prices
    - Estimate transaction fees
    - View network congestion
- [ ] Add API endpoints for:
    - /gas/current-price
    - /gas/estimate
    - /gas/network-status

## 3. Network Integration (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Sync gas prices across nodes
- [ ] Implement gas price consensus
- [ ] Add gas price broadcasting
- [ ] Handle gas price updates in block processing

## 4. Optimization & Monitoring (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Add gas usage metrics
- [ ] Implement gas price history tracking
- [ ] Create gas price adjustment algorithms based on:
    - Block fullness
    - Transaction wait times
    - Network load

## 5. Advanced Features (Priority: Low)
- [ ] Gas price predictions
- [ ] Priority queue based on gas prices
- [ ] Gas price alerts
- [ ] Fee suggestions based on transaction type

## 6. Documentation & Testing (Ongoing)
- [ ] API documentation
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] Performance benchmarks
- [ ] User guides

üìã Immediate Next Steps
Based on your codebase, I recommend starting with:
Complete Consensus Integration
Finish hybrid PoW+PoS implementation
Connect gas system with consensus
Implement validator rewards
Transaction System
Complete UTXO management
Integrate gas fee system with transactions
Add transaction validation
Network Layer
Complete peer management
Implement block propagation
Add chain sync
Would you like me to provide detailed implementation steps for any of these components? We can start with the most critical component first.






lets go
please this is our next step 
please implement it properly by updating the code in required file clealry if needed create new file only if its needed properly and for sure else update o add it in the relevant file only and aslo make the changes without breaking the code or functionalities properly please make or implement this features properly by updating the codes in required files @Codebase 










nah man i dont seem they are fixing properly because the fixies you are making are creasting trouble in other files which are depenened on this and cuaisng more issues i already said you to fix the issue propelry if it cause issue in the other file also fix it properly and also you are creating new files unwantedly and alot of redeclaration issues are raised by your fix , so we are changing the approach , first properly analsye the codebase and list all the issues in each file which has issues and clealry ecplain about the issues and why it occured and how to fix it , iam not talking about logical issues iam asking about compile time issue so please analyse and do the taks properly dont make any changes now @Codebase 



please fix the issues properly i also said you to keep in mind its just a simple pow+pos blockchain with no smart contract thing man its for school project and also in this the block creator and block validator are 2 different people miner creates a empty block and validator adds validates the block and tranasactions and add them to blokc i already informed all this to you and aasked to keep them in mind , so now please fix every issue in the @block.go  properly , by making changes in the files wherver it is neccessary and dont make any hardcoded data to fix the issue think it likereal blockchian @Codebase
